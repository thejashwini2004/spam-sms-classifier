# 📩 Spam SMS Classifier using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **not spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Built with Python and scikit-learn, the model achieves **97.9% accuracy** using the **Naive Bayes** classifier.
